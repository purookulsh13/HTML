<!--
    A table is a set of rows and columns.
    HTML supports tables to display tabular data (data that is structured into rows and columns).

    The <table> tag needs to include a <tr> tag for each row of the table.

    The <td> tag creates a table cell, which is contained inside the <tr> 
    and contains the content of the cell:

    The header is a collection of <th> cells which define the content of the cell or row.
