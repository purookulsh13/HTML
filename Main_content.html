<!--
    The main content of the page is defined using the <main> tag, 
    which can include various subsections represented by <article> and <section> tags.

    <article> encloses a block of content that makes sense on its own without the rest of the page, 
    such as a blog post.

    There needs to be a single <main> element on the page.
